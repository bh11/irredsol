\Chapter{Overview}

Let $n$ be a positive integer and $q$ a prime power satisfying  $q^n \<
2^{16}$. The package {\IRREDSOL} provides a library of irreducible
solvable subgroups of $GL(n, q)$, such that each irreducible solvable
subgroup of $GL(n, q)$ is conjugate to precisely one group in the library. 

35004 irreducibles and 28095 absolutely irreducibles

It is possible to construct groups in the {\IRREDSOL} 
library one at a time (see Section~"Low
level access functions"), by supplying four integer parameters identifying
the group in question. In addition, there are functions which facilitate 
searching the library for groups with given properties (see Section "Finding
matrix groups with given properties").

Given an irreducible solvable matrix group <G>, it is possible
to find the group in the library to which <G> is conjugate, see Sections
"identification of irreducible groups" and "identification of absolutely
irreducible groups".

Moreover, the {\IRREDSOL} package provides additional functionality
for matrix groups, such as the computation of imprimitivity systems;
see Chapter~"Additional functionality for matrix groups".

Finally, the library of irreducible solvable matrix groups over prime
fields translates into a library of isomorphism types of primitive solvable
groups. There are functions available to translate between such irreducible solvable
matrix groups and primitive groups, to search for primitive solvable groups with given 
properties, and functions to recognize them, up to isomorphism; 
see Sections "Translating between irreducible solvable matrix groups and primitive
solvable groups", "Finding primitive solvable permutation groups with given
properties",
and "Recognizing primitive solvable groups", respectively.

Note that {\GAP} provides another library of all irreducible solvable
subgroups of $GL(n, p)$, where $p$ is a prime and $p^n \< 2^8$ originally
created by Mark Short and with two omissions in $GL(2,13)$ added later; 
see Section "ref:Irreducible Solvable Matrix Groups" in the {\GAP} reference manual. All of
these groups are,  of course, also part of the {\IRREDSOL} data base. The {\IRREDSOL}
package provides functions to translate from the numbering used in the {\GAP} library
to the numbering used in {\IRREDSOL} and back; see
Section~"Compatibility with other data libraries".

The groups in the {\IRREDSOL} data base were constructed using the methods
described by Bettina Eick and the author in \cite{EH}, where the 
construction of all irreducible solvable subgroups of $GL(n, q)$ with $q^n \< 3^8$
is described.

For a historic account of the classification of irreducible matrix groups and
primitive permutation groups, the reader is referred to \cite{Sho} and, 
for recent developments, to~\cite{EH}.
