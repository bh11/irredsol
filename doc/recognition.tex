\Chapter{Recognition of matrix groups}

This chapter describes some functions which, given an irreducible matrix 
group, identify a group in the {\IRREDSOL} library which is conjugate
to that group. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Identification of irreducible groups}

\>IdIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroupAvailable(<G>) F

This function returns true if `IdIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup' (see
"IdIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup" will work for the group <G>.


\>IdIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup(<G>) A

If the matrix group <G> is solvable and irreducible over $F
= `FieldOfMatrixGroup'(<G>)$, (see "ref:FieldOfMatrixGroup"), and a conjugate in
$GL(<n>, <F>)$ of $<G>$ belongs to the database of  irreducible solvable groups in
{\IRREDSOL}, this function returns a list `[<n>, <q>, <d>, <k>]' such that <G> is
conjugate to  `IrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup'(<n>, <q>, <d>, <k>) (see
"IrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup").


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Identification of absolutely irreducible groups}

\>`IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroupAvailable(<G>)'%
{IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroupAvailable}%
@{`IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvable\\MatrixGroupAvailable'} F

This function returns true if `IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup' (see
"IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup" will work for the group <G>.


\>IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup(<G>) A

If the matrix group <G> is solvable and absolutely irreducible, and if 
 a conjugate in
$GL(<n>, <F>)$ of $<G>$ belongs to the database of  irreducible solvable groups in
{\IRREDSOL}, this function returns a list `[<n>, <q>, <k>]' such that <G> is
conjugate to  `AbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup'(<n>, <q>, <k>) (see
"AbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup").


\>`RecognitionAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup(%
   <G>, <wantmat>, <wantgroup>)'%
{RecognitionAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup}%
@{`RecognitionAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvable\\MatrixGroup'} F
\>`RecognitionAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroupNC(%
   <G>, <wantmat>,<wantgroup>)'%
{RecognitionAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroupNC}%
@{`RecognitionAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvable\\MatrixGroupNC'} F

Let G be an absolutely irreducible solvable matrix group over a finite field. 
Theses functions identify a conjugate H of G group in the library. 
They return a record which has the following entries:
\beginitems
`id' &  contains the id of H (and thus of
G); cf. `IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup'
("IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup"

`mat' (optional) &
a
matrix <x> such that $G^x = H$

`group' (optional) & the group H 

\enditems
The entries `mat' and `group' are only present if the booleans <wantmat> and/or
<wantgroup> are true, respectively. Note that in most cases, the function may 
be much slower if wantmat is set to true.  

The `NC' version does not check its arguments. It returns `fail' if
the group <G> is beyond the scope of the IRREDSOL library; see
`IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroupAvailable'
("IdAbsolutelyIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroupAvailable"), while the
ordinary version raises an error in this case.

\Section{Compatibility with other data libraries}

A library of irreducible solvable subgroups of $GL(n, p)$, where $p$ is a 
prime and $p^n leq 255$ already exists in GAP. The following functions
allow to translate between these libraries. 


\>IdIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroupIndexMS(<n>, <p>, <k>) F

This function returns the id (see "IdIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup") of <G>, 
where <G> is `IrreducibleSolvableGroupMS'(<n>, <p>, <k>) (see "ref:IrreducibleSolvableGroupMS").


\>IndexMSIdIrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup(<n>, <q>, <d>, <k>) F

This function returns a triple [<n>, <p>, <l>] such that
`IrreducibleSolvableGroupMS'(<n>, <p>, <l>)' (see "ref:IrreducibleSolvableGroupMS") is conjugate to
`IrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup'(<n>, <q>, <d>, <k>) (see "IrreducibleSolvableMatrixGroup").
