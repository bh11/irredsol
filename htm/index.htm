    Description

</H2>


<P>Let n be a positive integer and q a prime power satisfying  q^n < 65536.
The package IRREDSOL constitutes a library of irreducible
solvable subgroups of GL(n, q), such that each irreducible solvable
subgroup of
GL(n, q) is conjugate to precisely one group in the library. 

<P>This data base is
intended to replace and extend  the data base of irreducible matrix groups
over prime fields created by Mark Short \cite{Sho which is also part of
GAP. There are functions available to translate from Mark Short's
numbering of groups to the numbering used in IRREDSOL and back.

<P>It is possible to construct groups in this list one at a time, by supplying four
integer parameters identifying the group in question. In addition, there are
functions which facilitate  searching the library for groups with given properties.

<P>Given an irreducible solvable matrix group <I>G</I>, it is possible
to find the group in the library to which <I>G</I> is conjugate.

<P>Moreover,, the IRREDSOL package provides additional functionality
for matrix groups, such as the computation of imprimitivity systems.

<P>Finally, the library of irreducible solvable matrix groups over prime
fields translates into a library of isomorphism types of primitive solvable
groups. There are functions avalable which faciliate this
translation.
