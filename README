                     The IRREDSOL package
                        Version 1.0.2

Let n be a positive integer and q a prime power satisfying  q^n < 65536.
The package IRREDSOL constitutes a library of irreducible
solvable subgroups of GL(n, q), such that each irreducible solvable
subgroup of
GL(n, q) is conjugate to precisely one group in the library. 

This data base is
intended to replace and extend  the data base of irreducible matrix groups
over prime fields created by Mark Short \cite{Sho which is also part of
GAP. There are functions available to translate from Mark Short's
numbering of groups to the numbering used in IRREDSOL and back.

It is possible to construct groups in this list one at a time, by supplying four
integer parameters identifying the group in question. In addition, there are
functions which facilitate  searching the library for groups with given properties.

Given an irreducible solvable matrix group <G>, it is possible
to find the group in the library to which <G> is conjugate.

Moreover,, the IRREDSOL package provides additional functionality
for matrix groups, such as the computation of imprimitivity systems.

Finally, the library of irreducible solvable matrix groups over prime
fields translates into a library of isomorphism types of primitive solvable
groups. There are functions avalable which faciliate this
translation.

This version of IRREDSOL requires at least GAP 4.3.

In order to install IRREDSOL, you have to get the archive file `irredsol-1r0n2.zoo'.

You can download `irredsol-1r0n2.zoo' from the same places as GAP. The main FTP
servers are:

ftp://ftp-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/pub/gap/gap4/share/
ftp://ftp.math.rwth-aachen.de/pub/gap4/share/
ftp://ftp.ccs.neu.edu/pub/mirrors/ftp-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/pub/gap/gap4/share/
ftp://pell.anu.edu.au/pub/algebra/gap4/share/

or, alternatively, from the author's home page at

http://www.tu-bs.de/~bhoeflin/irredsol/index.html

To install IRREDSOL, move the file `irredsol-1r0n2.zoo' into the `pkg' directory in
which you plan to install IRREDSOL. Usually, this will be the directory `pkg'
in the GAP directory. 

If you already have a previous version of IRREDSOL, that is, there is a directory
`irredsol' in the `pkg' directory, delete (or rename) this directory first.

Then unzoo `irredsol-1r0n2.zoo' by starting `unzoo' and type

    -x irredsol-1r0n2

(and <return>) at the prompt. (To quit `unzoo', enter <return> when the prompt
re-appears.)

That's all. Now start GAP and type

    RequirePackage ("irredsol");

This should return `true'.
