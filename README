                     The IRREDSOL package
                        Version 1.0.9

IRREDSOL is a GAP package which provides a library of all irreducible 
solvable subgroups of GL(n, q), up to conjugacy, where n is a positive
integer and q a prime power satisfying q^n < 2^16.
This version of IRREDSOL requires at least GAP 4.4.

In order to install IRREDSOL, you have to get the archive file 
`irredsol-1r0n9.zoo'. It is available for download from

http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/irredsol.html

To install IRREDSOL, move the file `irredsol-1r0n9.zoo' into the `pkg' 
directory in which you plan to install IRREDSOL. Usually, this will be 
the directory `pkg' in the GAP directory. 

If you already have a previous version of IRREDSOL, that is, there is a 
directory `irredsol' in the `pkg' directory, delete this directory first 
(or move it outside the pkg directory).

Then unzoo `irredsol-1r0n9.zoo' by starting `unzoo' and type

    -x irredsol-1r0n9

(and <return>) at the prompt. (To quit `unzoo', enter <return> when the 
prompt re-appears.)

That's all. Now you should have a directory `irredsol' inside your package 
directory. Now start GAP and type

    LoadPackage ("irredsol");

This should return `true'.
